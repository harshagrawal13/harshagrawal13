# Harsh Agrawal
I develop foundational models for protein multimers at [Softnanolab](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.angioletti-uberti/about) under Dr. Stefano Angioletti Uberti. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Bioengineering at Imperial College London. 

## Research
- **Remodelling existing peptide binders to elicit novel toxicity to C. Elegans (Feb 2024 - December 2024)**
  Remodelling non-toxic binders to screen for  
- **JESPR — Energy Based Modelling for Proteins** (May 2023–Present)  
  Implementing contrastive pre-training to learn sequence–structure representations for protein foundation models; built sharding and activation-checkpointed multi-GPU training for 500M+ parameter models; evaluating zero-shot performance on solubility, stability, etc. Code: [github.com/atom-51/jespr](https://github.com/atom-51/jespr).
- **Cancer-eX — Detecting Pancreatic Cancer Early** (Aug 2018–Aug 2021)  
  Studied salivary biomarkers for early GI cancer detection and prototyped a lateral-flow assay; designed and calibrated a competitive ELISA protocol; built a risk-assessment tool using etiological relative-risk factors.
